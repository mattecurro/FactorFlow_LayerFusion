"""
Class wrapping a list of levels into an architecture.
In FF, the terms outermost and innermost refer to the first and last elements
in the list, in accordance with the HW componenets represented by levels.

This class becomes operational in 5 steps:
1) construction of the 'Level' instances it wraps <- per-level arguments
2) construction of this class <- levels, coupling
3) initialization and validation of all 'Level' instances with calls to 'initArch'
4) validation of the target computation and its coupling with a call to 'checkCouplingCompatibility' <- computation, coupling
opt) relaxation of constraints to accomodate the computation with a a call to 'fitConstraintsToComp' <- comp
5) initialization of this class with a call to 'initFactors' <- computation

Constructor arguments:
- levels: the list of levels for the architecture
- coupling: dimensions and dimension-operand coupling
- name: the name for the architecture
