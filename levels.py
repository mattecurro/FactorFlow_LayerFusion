"""
A Memory Level within the architecture, with the possibility to store
data and provide it as tiles to the levels below it.

Constructor arguments:
- name: the level's name
- size: the capacity (in number-of-operands, disregarding bits per operand)
- value_access_energy: energy required by each access of one value (in pJ)
                       [w.r.t. Timeloop this is the vector access energy / elements per
                       vector, also called energy-per-scalar-access]
  - Note: if specified, it has priority over wordline_access_energy. At least one of
          value_access_energy and wordline_access_energy must be specified.
- wordline_access_energy: energy required by each wordline access (in pJ)
  - Note: at least one of value_access_energy and wordline_access_energy must be specified.
          Specifying wordline_access_energy requires word_bits and value_bits to be both
          specified as well.
- word_bits: size in bits of the memory's wordlines.
- value_bits: size in bits of the values stored on the memory. This is the same for all
          operands, castings are implicitly assumed to take place whenever needed.
- leakage_energy: energy leaked each clock cycle by the component (in pJ/cc)
- area: the area occupied by the memory (in um^2).
- bandwidth: the bandwidth for reads and writes, it will be divided in 1/2 for
             read and 1/2 for write (in operands/clock-cycle)
- dataflow: specifies the dimensions over which to iterate, defaults to all dimensions
- factors: specifies the initial factors for this level, should not be normally
           specified aside for initializing MSE from a specific configuration
- tile_sizes: specifies the initial tile sizes for this level, should not be normally
              specified aside for initializing MSE from a specific configuration,
              in which case it must be consistent with any other factors initialization
- factors_constraints: constraints on the factors that must be placed on this level.
                      Valid dictionary keys use dimension names, e.g. for a GEMM:
                          - 'M', 'K', and 'N' for exact values;
                          - 'M<=', 'K<=', and 'N<=' for upper bounds;
                          - 'M>=', 'K>=', and 'N>=' for lower bounds;
                      NOTE: the use of the '<=' and '>=' constraints does not shorten the
                            mapper's runtime as much as exact constraints.
- dataflow_constraints: constraints for the order of loops at this level, for any dim not
                        specified here, all permutations are tried while keeping fixed the
                        relative order of constrained dimensions. A placeholder "_" can be
                        used to mark the place where non-specified dimensions are allowed
                        to be inserted. If any "_" is used, the total number of specified
                        dimensions or placeholders must be equal to those in the coupling.
                        E.g., for GEMMs, valid strings are 'M', 'K', 'N', and "_", ["N", "M"]
                        and ["N", "_", "_"] are valid constraints, while ["_", "N"] is not.
                        With ["N", "M"], valid dataflows are NMK, NKM, and KNM.
                        With ["N", "_", "_"] valid dataflows are NMK, NKM.
- bypasses: list of operands which should bypass this level (i.o.w. not be stored here),
            valid strings are 'in', 'w', and 'out'.
- multiple_buffering: factor of multiple buffering employed by this level, must be >1
- multiple_reuses: if True (default) both stationarity reuse (loops skip) and halo reuse can be
                   leveraged at once. Otherwise only the one bound to the innermost loop is leveraged.
- read_value_access_energy: energy required for reads accesses, if specified overrides value_access_energy
- write_value_access_energy: energy required for write accesses, if specified overrides value_access_energy
  - Note: either both or none of read_value_access_energy and write_value_access_energy must be specified.
- read_wordline_access_energy: energy required for reads accesses, if specified overrides wordline_access_energy
- write_wordline_access_energy: energy required for write accesses, if specified overrides wordline_access_energy
  - Note: either both or none of read_wordline_access_energy and write_wordline_access_energy must be specified.
- read_bandwidth: bandwidth allocated for reads, if specified overrides "bandwidth"
- write_bandwidth: bandwidth allocated for writes, if specified overrides "bandwidth"
  - Note: either both or none of read_bandwidth and write_bandwidth must be specified

    Returns the memory operations between this level and the one below it.

    coming upward from lower levels. In other words, reads and writes
    between this level and the one(s) below it.

    => The returned value must be multiplied by the iterations happening
       on levels above this one in order to get the true total.

    Bypasses are handled like this:
    If this level is the last before a bypass of a certain operand, it
    will be invoking this same method on the last level before the next
    one which does not bypass the operand in question.

    For example:
    We have a memory hierarchy with levels L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5, where:

        L2 is configured to bypass weights
        L3 is configured to bypass weights
        L4 stores weights again
        In this case, when L1 needs to send weight data downward,
        instead of communicating with L2 (which would normally be next), 
        it communicates directly with L4 (the next level that actually handles weights).
        This creates a "virtual connection" that jumps over the bypassed levels

    This way MOPs are computed w.r.t. the tile size of such level, which
    corresponds with the actual tiles being accessed from this level.
    For each level encountered in between, MOPs are scaled accordingly.
    

    Lastly, factors encountered on dimensions orthogonal to the output
    are returned too, to allow the caller to remove one such iteration
    to account for the presence or absence of the bias (bias_read flag).
    
    Arguments:
    - in_bp, w_bp, out_bp: whether the respective operands are bypassed or not,
                           defaults to the instance's setting if not provided.
                           Values are '0' for bypass, '1' for keep.
    - ignore_bypasses: if True, MOPs are returned only relative to this level's
                       accesses from strictly adjacent levels, bypassed operands
                       will thus show 0 MOPs.

A Spatial Fanout Level within the architecture, the core of a spatial architecture,
all subsequent levels will be replicated "mesh" times, each replica executing one
of the iterations done by this level, by each running the same inner loops as the
others, with partially different data.

Constructor arguments:
- name: the level's name
- mesh: the maximum spatial fanout available at this level
- dim: single dimension to spatially unroll at this level, if dim is specified,
       dims must not be specified
- dims: list of dimensions to spatially unroll at this level, if dims is specified,
        dim must not be specified. The order in dims does not matter.
- area: the area occupied by the entire interconnect (in um^2).
- pe_to_pe: if True, data is not multicasted in one shot, but sent to only the first
            fanout entry, which then forwards it to the second, and so on, just like
            the operands flowing in/out of a systolic array (or, like in a pipeline).
            This adds a warmup overhead to latency, but does not affect the total MOPs.
- spatial_multicast_support: True (default) if this level supports spatial multicast.
        By itself, this only allows the same identical tile of an operand to be sent
        to each instance at once identically.
- spatial_reduction_support: same as 'spatial_multicast_support' but for spatial reduction.
- selective_multicast_support: enables sending parts of a read tile selectively to one
        or more different instances. In other words, if enabled, all values required
        by all instances are read once, with each instance receiving only the part of its
        interest. When disabled, each instance [involved in the spatial unrolling of a
        dimension present in a sum of indices] issues its own independent read for the
        values it needs. Obviously, this is useful only when fanouts unfold spatially
        dimensions involved in a sum of indices (e.g. those of the input tensor of a
        convolution), it does not make a difference otherwise (e.g. on GEMMs).
        Can only be True if 'spatial_multicast_support' is already True. Default is False.
- selective_reduction_support: same as 'selective_multicast_support' but for reduction.
        Can only be True if 'spatial_reduction_support' is already True. Default is False.
- power_gating_support: True if instances immediately following this level can be
                        power-gated when not in use, saving leakage power.
- factors: specifies the initial factors for this level, should not be normally
           specified aside for initializing MSE from a specific configuration
- tile_sizes: specifies the initial tile sizes for this level, should not be normally
              specified aside for initializing MSE from a specific configuration,
              in which case it must be consistent with any other factors initialization
- factors_constraints: constraints on the factors that must be placed on this level.
                      Valid dictionary keys use dimension names, e.g. for a GEMM:
                          - 'M', 'K', and 'N' for exact values;
                          - 'M<=', 'K<=', and 'N<=' for upper bounds;
                          - 'M>=', 'K>=', and 'N>=' for lower bounds;
                      NOTE: the use of the '<=' and '>=' constraints does not shorten the
                            mapper's runtime as much as exact constraints.

# Currently fanout levels reuse all operands mapped on them, period. However this should be up to hardware support.

"""
A Compute Level within the architecture, it is a placeholder for any processing
element (PE) capable of multiply and accumulate (MAC).

NOTE: iterations at this level are equivalent to requiring that a PE can, in the
clock-cycles specified in "cycles", execute all such iterations. It is also assumed
that the data required for all iterations done at this level is held within hardware
registers whose energy cost is modeled by the "compute energy", together with the
actual compute cost. As such, iterations done here are equivalent to a PE capable
of multiple concurrent (parallel or pipelined (chaining accumulation output)) MACs.
Then intuitively, increasing the number of iterations done at this level linearly
increases the required bandwidth of all memory levels feeding it, as they need to
keep up with the concurrent MACs done here.

NOTE: no value is kept stationary on a ComputeLevel, the values for each MAC
operation are read/written every time. PE-level stationarity is realized by the
first Memory Level above compute.
NOTE: values that partake in multiple MAC operations performed concurrently in the
iterations of the ComputeLevel are read/written once per MAC.
TODO: move the multicast/reduction and selective_multicast/selective_reduction
to the SpatialLevel and make them available on ComputeLevel too. Then make the
above NOTEs conditional on the True or False of those properties too! These would
take effect during MemLevel.MOPs, just like they do for FanoutLevel, since also
the ComputeLevel is included in MemLevel.next_spatials!

Constructor arguments:
- name: the level's name
- mesh: how many concurrent (parallel or pipelined) MACs the compute element
        can perform within "cycles" clock-cycles.
- compute_energy: the energy required for a single MAC (regardless of how many
                  you run concurrently), accounting for all computation-related
                  costs at the PE level.
- cycles: the number of clock cycles of latency required to execute "size" MACs
- leakage_energy: energy leaked each clock cycle by the component (in pJ/cc)
- area: the area occupied by the entire PE (in um^2).
- dim: single dimension along which MAC operations are picked to run concurrently
       on this level, if dim is specified, dims must not be specified
       NOTE: when mesh is 1, both dim and dims can be omitted
- dims: list of dimensions from which MAC operations are picked to run concurrently
       on this level, if dims is specified, dim must not be specified.
       The order in dims does not matter.
       NOTE: when mesh is 1, both dim and dims can be omitted
- factors: specifies the initial factors for this level, should not be normally
           specified aside for initializing MSE from a specific configuration
- tile_sizes: specifies the initial tile sizes for this level, should not be normally
              specified aside for initializing MSE from a specific configuration,
              in which case it must be consistent with any other factors initialization
- factors_constraints: constraints on the factors that must be placed on this level.
                      Valid dictionary keys use dimension names, e.g. for a GEMM:
                          - 'M', 'K', and 'N' for exact values;
                          - 'M<=', 'K<=', and 'N<=' for upper bounds;
                          - 'M>=', 'K>=', and 'N>=' for lower bounds;
                      NOTE: the use of the '<=' and '>=' constraints does not shorten the
                            mapper's runtime as much as exact constraints.
